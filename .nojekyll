Ode to Nojekyll

In the land of pages static,  
Where Jekyll roams with art and magic,  
There lies a silent, subtle friend,  
Nojekyll, whose grace won't bend.

No fuss, no muss, no ruby fuss,  
A simple touch, a quiet trust.  
Just one small file, a hidden guide,  
To let raw HTML glide.

With Nojekyll, there's no need  
For build commands or extra heed.  
Just push your files, your thoughts so pure,  
A static site, so quick, so sure.

Markdown, Liquid, step aside,  
For in this realm, plain files abide.  
Nojekyll stands, a gatekeeper true,  
To let simplicity shine through.

Oh Nojekyll, we sing your praise,  
For in your path, no clutter stays.  
A silent hero, clear and free,  
You keep our sites in harmony.

So here’s to you, Nojekyll’s might,  
For keeping things both clear and light.  
In a world of complex, layered tech,  
You bring us back, to plain and spec.
